==============
The web site Chicago is made with Aptana Studio 3 as a result of an University assignement for the course of Web Design.
The idea for this web site was to implement one bug web design trend, more precisely "paralax scrolling".
Parallax scrolling is an interesting technique, where, as you scroll, the background images translate slower than the 
content in the foreground, creating the illusion of 3D depth.
